# 22.2.2---Note-Taker---Challenge-No.11

## What I learned

Having gone back and completed this challenge later I realize that if I had to do it from the beginning I would use different tech to accomplish this, having the database render only on hard refresh made this very difficult for me. I also spent way too much time trying to truly remove list items from the column 
on the left. I finally settled on setting display to none when the delete button is clicked.
